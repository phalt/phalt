You probably stumbled here through Twitter or one of my GitHub projects.

I write open source software. I like Python and JS.

You may know me from either:

1) [PokeAPI](https://github.com/pokeapi/pokeapi)
2) [Beckett](https://github.com/phalt/beckett)
3) [SWAPI](https://github.com/phalt/swapi)
4) [Django API Domains](https://github.com/phalt/django-api-domains)

Or general Python things. I'm a member of the https://python.nz/ commitee.

## Not Programming

🐦 I do [The Tweets](https://twitter.com/phalt_).

👖 I'm really into Raw Denim jeans.

🤖 I like Cyberpunk more than you do.

🦎 I live in Aotearoa New Zealand. Ko ia te ātaahua.

🍸 We should eat the rich and you should join a union.

## Who is Case?

The internet was cooler when we had pseudonyms or nom de plumes.

**Case** or **Case Atreides** is the name I use in places that I don't want to associate with the meatspace "Paul Hallett".

Case, from [Neuromancer](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Neuromancer). Atreides from [Dune](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Dune_(novel)).

Mum named me after Paul Atreides, so using that as a pseudonym is out!
